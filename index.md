### Diagetic UI

In this project I have made a UI system that tries not to take away from the player and is incorporated to the game.

In this image it is a small watch that the player is holding showing them their current health and a little message welcoming them. I made it very small to still give the player ample room to see their surroundings.

The player can close the watch allowing them to have full view of their environment.

![HealthBar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54685877/153338513-9cb2030e-33ad-4c57-bae7-d1e13875c70e.png)

I made the materials used on the watch where the first image shows the background where I was going for a holographic look and the second image is the healthbar that changes color depending on your health state where full is green and near death is red.
